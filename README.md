# DataAnalytics

This repository contains Python scripts for manipulating and analyzing weather data from a `weatherData.csv` file using various data analytics techniques and libraries.

## Repository Contents

Currently, this repository includes:
- `weatherData.csv`: Raw data file containing weather data from Australia.
- Python scripts:
  - `unique.py`: Script for getting unique data and pulling information from csv.
  - `pressue.py`: Script that calculates different pressures and the probability of rainfall.

## Planned Updates

In the future, I plan to progressively upload additional Python scripts that utilize different data analytics techniques, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
Each script will be accompanied by a brief explanation of its purpose and usage.

## Usage

To use the scripts in this repository:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the scripts in your Python environment.
